The dataset consist of customers activity along a churn label. My task is to explore and analyse the dataset and get understanding of the dataset. First of all I will import some important libraries which will help me to do computational task and visualize the data. Then reading the data and try to get first look of the dataset. Then I will check shape of the data like what is the number of rows and columns. After that checking the info of the data to see data type and counts of non null values for each feature. Then I will check if there is any duplicate row or not. After the I have to check null and missing values for each column then I will get data understanding like what are the names of columns and description of each column. After that I will check number of unique values for each column and also what the unique values are. Further I will make some questions and try to give the answer of the questions. Then I will do data wrangling like cleaning and merging and dropping the columns. Next I will do uni-variate visualization like distribution of the column of the data after that I will perform bi-variate visualization like relationship between two column at the end I will do multi-variate visualization like correlations between the columns. After visualization I will have to give some suggestion to the client and finally I will add conclusion of the project."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["BUSINESS PROBLEM OVERVIEW\n","\n","Customer churn prediction is extremely important for any business as it recognizes the clients who are likely to stop using their services.\n","\n","In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.\n","\n","For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, you will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, do exploratory data analysis to identify the main indicators why customers are leaving the company."],"metadata":{"id":"DpeJGUA3kjGy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### **Define Your Business Objective?**"],"metadata":{"id":"PH-0ReGfmX4f"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Finding factors and cause which influence customers to churn.\n","Maximize company profit by retaining customers.\n","Retain churn customers by taking suitable action.\n","Reducing customers churn rate.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"PhDvGCAqmjP1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **General Guidelines** : -  "],"metadata":{"id":"mDgbUHAGgjLW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
